Have mercy upon me, O Lord, have mercy upon me.</p><p>'To thy fatherly protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and defend them, that they may so pass through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.'</p><p>One cannot read this prayer, without some emotions not very favourable to the lady whose conduct occasioned it.</p></div> </div>
