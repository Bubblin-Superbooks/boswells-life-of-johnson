   Once, upon reading that line in the curious epitaph quoted
   in The Spectator,
   'Born in New-England, did in London die;'
   he laughed and said, 'I do not wonder at this.  It would
   have been strange, if born in London, he had died in
   New-England.'—BOSWELL.</p></blockquote><p>TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS:—</p><p>Ashbourne, Sept. 2. '. . . I still continue by God's mercy to mend. My breath is easier, my nights are quieter, and my legs are less in bulk, and stronger in use. I have, however, yet a great deal to overcome, before I can yet attain even an old man's health. Write, do write to me now and then; we are now old acquaintance, and perhaps few people have lived so much and so long together, with less cause of complaint on either side. The retrospection of this is very pleasant, and I hope we shall never think on each other with less kindness.'</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Sept. 9.
