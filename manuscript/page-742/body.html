It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things.'</p><p>We were by no means pleased with our inn at Bristol. 'Let us see now, (said I, how we should describe it.' Johnson was ready with his raillery. 'Describe it, Sir?â€”Why, it was so bad that Boswell wished to be in Scotland!')</p><p>After Dr. Johnson's return to London, I was several times with him at his house, where I occasionally slept, in the room that had been assigned to me. I dined with him at Dr. Taylor's, at General Oglethorpe's, and at General Paoli's. To avoid a tedious minuteness, I shall group together what I have preserved of his conversation during this period also, without specifying each scene where it passed, except one, which will be found so remarkable as certainly to deserve a very particular relation.</p></div> </div>
