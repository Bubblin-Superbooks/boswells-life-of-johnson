I regretted much leaving London, where I had formed many agreeable connexions: "Sir, (said he, I don't wonder at it; no man, fond of letters, leaves London without regret. But remember, Sir, you have seen and enjoyed a great deal;â€”you have seen life in its highest decorations, and the world has nothing new to exhibit.
